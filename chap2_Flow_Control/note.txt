break       helps yu break out of a while loop
continue    moves to the next iteration
range       iterates from 0 to n-1
            accepts three parameters
                (start, end, step) 
                where step is how many steps and if negative, backwards

importing modules
import moduleTye
            random      randome.randint()
            sys         sys.exit()
            os
            math
            time        time.sleep(float/int)

from ____ import moduleType

**the difference between them is that you still hvae to spell out the former 
----example:----
former:     random.randint(num, num2)
latter:     randint(num, num2)


sys.exit()      Terminates a program
